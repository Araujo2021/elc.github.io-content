<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->

In my 4th year of University I had what would become one of my favorite courses, Simulation, where, as a final project, each student (or team of students) should choose a real problematic situation and create a simulation model (with AnyLogic). I choose something I was familiar with, the never ending queue of the elevators of the University building, I asked for the blueprints and simulate several alternatives to find which was the best.

In case you never heard of what simulation is let me introduce you to this incredible world. For those who are already familiar with it, you can [skip the introduction section](#context) or if you prefer, jump directly to the [computational model](#model)

## Introduction

Simulation is a way of problem solving, it basically consist in translate a problem into a digital world, propose changes or alternatives in the digital world and then choose the best to be applied in the real world.

Why is this necessary or useful?

Many processes can't be stopped or delayed, industries for example, can just stop producing in order to test alternatives that might result in terrible outcomes! For this reason, it is safer, cheaper and much more convenient to use simulation.

What are the advantages?

Simulation Software companies usually compare simulation with working with spreadsheets (such as Excel) in order to make decision and, although spreadsheets are really useful for some problems, when it comes to testing alternatives of the real world, a dynamic, interactive and more visual approach is preferred, specially when taking to non-technical people, who probably will be the ones making the final decision.

How can be done?

Simulation software exists, both commercial and open-source and when a graphic user interface (GUI) is not needed, even some programming languages can be used with some additional libraries. In this article I'll be talking about AnyLogic software, which has a free student license.
