Hello visitor, my name is Ezequiel Leonardo Casta√±o, I'm a follower of Jesus and an engineering student and I decided to start thi blog to show other people what I learn from the Bible while at the same time publish content mainly related to Engineering, Programming and Math.

## My Lifestyle

As I said before I'm a theist, and particularly I believe in the Biblical God and in Jesus as the Messiah. That said, I don't think that is something one can only say and live as it were just a curious detail. Whether other people agree or not, I strongly defend that our believes determines our way of thinking (even for those who deny God's existence). Following Jesus is a choice I made and that changed my entire life, and this way is how the Bible teaches it should be. Nothing like the cold and distant traditions most people believe is "religion".

In case you don't know what christian faith is, I have a Youtube channel (skielcast) where you can search for videos or look for "William Lane Craig" or "Ravi Zacharias" they would explain it much better that I ever could.

My personal experience is the following: I realised I've sinned, sin is everything that deviates from the original purpose of God, whether they be thoughts, acts or words. God didn't want me to suffer for the consequences of my sin, which are eternal death, so He became human (Jesus) and gave his life for me in the cross, paying what I should have paid. He, even knowing that I was completely against His will, came, suffer and died so I could have a now restored relationship with God. How wouldn't I adore that mercy God? Now, in response to such a great act of love, I decide to surrender myself, to willingly become his servant.

## My Studies

I started studying engineering in 2015, this is my fifth year and I expect to finish it in 2020, the degree is translated as "Information Systems Engineering" which is in the middle of Compute Science and Management. The idea is to be close to the non-developers while still able to understand technical information, math and programming.

I've learned loads of new things in the university, particularly to always try to see the big picture. My favourite subjects are those related with mathematical and statistical models such as Simulation, Machine Learning and Data Visualizations, I also have a big interest in Education and open source.

In the language field, I'm a native Spanish speaker, I studied English for 7 years achieving a C1 certification (Cambridge) and now I'm studying German for applying to an scholarship in Germany.

## My research

Universities have a curriculum, each course has a syllabus but maybe what you need in the "real world" is not there. When I realize this, I started to learn on my own (although I was always a self-learner), reading books, subscribing to Youtube channels, newsletters and so on. I discover a lot of things but what I'm most interested in is Data Science. I'm currently in several research groups at University, some of which are about Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
