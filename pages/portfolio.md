## Education

**Python For Programmers Course (Originally in Spanish) - [Full Course on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6L8P83xTjQ43lioPhb7liCeg5fe6ucaE){: target="_blank"}**

I recorded a 4.5 hs course where I explained Python for an audience with some programming background, it covers both basic and complex aspects such as Context Managers, Decorators, Generators, and Coroutines. The content and code are publicly available.

## Data Science Projects

**Bayesian Networks for YouTube - [Research Paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344303125_Using_Hybrid_Bayesian_Networks_to_Detect_Audience_Behaviour_Changes_in_Youtube){: target="_blank"}**

With Professor Guillermo Leale we presented in the European Modelling and Simulation Symposium a research paper where we analyzed YouTube data and implemented a model to identify non-trivial changepoints in a stable channel.

**New Gene Genetic Algorithms - [Research Paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341785248_New_Gene-Level_Probabilistic_Genetic_Algorithm_to_Solve_Multi_Local_Minima_Problems){: target="_blank"}**

During my studies abroad and as a final project for the course "Research Skills" I wrote an open-access Paper with the title "New Gene-Level Probabilistic Genetic Algorithm to Solve Multi Local Minima Problems". The paper covers a new approach to Genetic Algorithms and compares it with the canonical version of the algorithm.

**Lane Detection for Autonomous Driving**

As part of my exchange semester in Germany, I worked in the Process Optimization department as a research student and I worked in a team developing a lane detection algorithm for a scaled car. The technologies used were Python, OpenCV, and Robotic Operative System (ROS)

**ODE Problems with Python - [Blog Post](https://elc.github.io/posts/ordinary-differential-equations-with-python/)**

Different ODE Problems were solved with Python, including different scenarios, like stable, unstable, phase diagram, univariate, multivariate, and basic plotting using Python and Matplotlib.

**Jupyter Map for Education - MapboxJS & GeoJSON - 2018 - [Git Repo](https://elc.github.io/jupyter-map/){: target="_blank"} - [Online Map <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://elc.github.io/jupyter-map/){: target="_blank"}**

This Interactive Web Map shows University Courses that use Jupyter notebooks. It was built with data collected from the professors and formated in a GeoJSON file and plotted using MapboxJS.

## Simulation Projects

**Inventory Control Simulation - Python 2020 - [Resources Available Soon]**

With Gast√≥n Amengual we developed a Monte-Carlo Inventory control simulation using a discrete-event paradigm and Python. This will be presented in the National Congress for Informatics and Systems Engineering in 2020 Fall.

**Elevators Simulation - AnyLogic - 2018 - [Blog Post](https://elc.github.io/posts/multi-floor-elevator-simulation-anylogic/) - [AnyLogic Cloud](https://elc.github.io/link/simulation-model){: target="_blank"}**

This is a simulation model in which the elevator of the university was represented. It was built with the AnyLogic software and the Free Learning Edition. The model can be [run online](https://elc.github.io/link/simulation-model){: target="_blank"}, as many times as you want. Some of its features are:

- Traffic Flow map for each floor (Heatmap).
- Stairs as an auxiliary system for the people that abandon the queue.
- Custom distribution for the destination floors of each person.
- Some of the KPIs:
    - Average Waiting Time.
    - Average length of the queue.
    - Utilization.

## Software Development Projects

**Personal Website - Pelican & Python - 2018-Present - [Git Repo](https://github.com/ELC/elc.github.io-source){: target="_blank"}**

I developed this website using Pelican, and some plugins (some of which I programmed myself). It is a completely static, lightweight, and modern website using only freely available technologies to share my articles, which are about both personal and professional topics.

Some of the features of the website are:

- Deploying and Integration with **TravisCI**.
- Hosted in **Github Pages** and **Netlify** as a backup.
- Dependencies management via **Pipenv**.
- Build automation with **Invoke** tasks and **Pipenv** Scripts.
- Theme is decoupled in a separate git repository.

The following features were provided via the plugins I developed:

- Service Worker **[Git Repo of Plugin](https://github.com/ELC/service_worker){: target="_blank"}**
    - A service worker is generated at build time which caches all lightweight static files.
    - The site can be viewed offline.
- Bundler **[Git Repo of Plugin](https://github.com/ELC/bundler_cache_busting){: target="_blank"}**
    - All the CSS and JS is bundle in a single file (one for each).
    - All the static files refenced in the HTML use Cache Busting.
- Shortener **[Git Repo of Plugin](https://github.com/ELC/shortener){: target="_blank"}**
    - Custom static shortener.
- Blur Thumbnails **[Git Repo of Plugin](https://github.com/ELC/blur_thumbnails){: target="_blank"}**
    - A blurred version of all the images is generated at build time.

This website was designed to work with the MinimalXYZ theme (see below) to achieve the best results, when using together, there are some additional features:

- All SCSS is compiled and compressed at build time.
- The images are lazily loaded with a blurred version when the connection isn't fast enough.
- The site can be installed on Android as PWA
- Comments via Disqus

Some other third-party plugins used provided the following features:

- Know the estimated time to read an article
- Automatically generate a sitemap
- Get the related posts of an article
- Use Gruvbox theme for code
- Auto-generate anchor tags for titles

**MinimalXYZ - Jinja2 HTML5 CSS3 JS Sass - 2018-Present - [Git Repo](https://github.com/ELC/MinimalXYZ){: target="_blank"}**

MinimalXYZ is the Pelican Theme used for this website. It first started as a fork of another theme called MinimalXY and completely rewrite it to my preference.

Some of its main features are:

- Use semantic HTML5 - No "containers" divs.
- All the internal JS and CSS is split into a separate file to obtain lightweight HTML
- Sass (SCSS) as a CSS preprocessor.
- Vanilla Javascript. No JQuery, Lodash, or similar ones to improve performance.
- CSS3 Transform for Animations.
- Responsive design.
- UI Features:
    - Hide menu bar on scroll down.
    - Show/Hide button to scroll to top.
    - Hamburger menu with animation top-down.
    - Toast notifications with animations
    - Smooth Scroll for anchor links
    - LightBox for images
  
This theme was developed specifically for this blog so many features that are possible because of the pelican build step such as:

- All SCSS is compiled and compressed at build time.
- Images are lazily loaded with a blurred version when the connection isn't fast enough.
- Comment system via Disqus

## Early Developments

These were my first projects, I have programmed several things earlier but these were the first time I developed a "complete system".

**Booking System - Java - 2017 - [Web](https://github.com/ELC/utn-java-final-assignment-web){: target="_blank"} - [Desktop](https://github.com/ELC/utn-java-final-assignment){: target="_blank"}**

A booking system implemented in the Java programming language which manages 3 main entities, people, bookable types, and bookable items. It creates bookings with no overlapping.

Some of its features are:

- CRUD of 3 different Classes (Users, Booking, and Items).
- Authentication and Authorization (Login and Roles).
- Email notifications when for confirmation (with tokens) and cancellation.

Non-Functional Requirements for both Web and Desktop:

- Develop the System both in Desktop and Web (Servlet and JSP).
- Use of Git and GitHub as a version control system.
- Architecture of 3 layers.
- Custom exceptions and Logs.
- Relational Database with stored procedures using MySQL.
- CRUS operations should be transactional.
